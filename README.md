# ElectionSystemWithSQL

The following project connects a Java project and a MySQL database.
My contribution to the project was creating the connection between the Java project and the DB.

About the project:
Since we like to have many elections in Israel, the parliament decided to create a database to manage the election process.
The system allows them to keep the data of all election campaigns in an orderly fashion.
Using this data, relevant professionals will be able to use the data for many uses.

Before the election, preliminary preparations:
  Add ballots.
  Adding parties.
  Adding citizens.
  Adding  candidates to a particular party.

During the election, The ballots are responsible to enter:
  For each citizen:
    Did he vote?
    If so, to which party?

At the end of the elections, The program presents the election results as follows:
  How many votes each party received from each ballot.
  How many votes in total did each party receive.
